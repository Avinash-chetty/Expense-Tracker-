# Expense Tracker (Python)

## 📌 Project Description

This is a **simple console-based Expense Tracker** built using **Python**. It allows users to record daily expenses, view all expenses, and calculate total spending. This project is beginner-friendly and is designed as a step into Python programming, data handling, and logic building.

The project uses **lists and dictionaries** to store expense data and provides a menu-driven interface for easy interaction.

## 📌 Sample Expense Categories

* Food
* Travel
* Makeup
* Books

(You can add more categories as needed.)

## 🧠 Python Concepts Explained

### 1️⃣ Variables and Data Types

* Variables are used to store data such as user choices, dates, categories, and amounts.
* Different data types are used:

  * `int` for menu choice
  * `float` for expense amount
  * `string` for date, category, and description

### 2️⃣ Lists

* A list named `expensesList` is used to store all expenses.
* Each expense is added to the list, allowing multiple records to be saved during runtime.

### 3️⃣ Dictionaries

* Each expense is stored as a dictionary.
* The dictionary contains key-value pairs such as:

  * `date`
  * `category`
  * `description`
  * `amount`
* This helps organize expense data in a structured format.

### 4️⃣ Loops

* A `while True` loop is used to keep the program running until the user chooses to exit.
* A `for` loop is used to:

  * Display all expenses
  * Calculate the total spending

### 5️⃣ Conditional Statements

* `if-elif-else` conditions are used to handle menu choices.
* Each menu option triggers a different block of code.

### 6️⃣ User Input and Output

* `input()` is used to take data from the user.
* `print()` is used to display menus, messages, and results.

### 7️⃣ Arithmetic Operations

* Addition is used to calculate the total expenses.
